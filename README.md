# ClickyGame

This application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time.
The user's score should be reset to 0 if user clicked the same image more than once.

* Every time an image is clicked, the images shuffle themselves in a random order.
* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
